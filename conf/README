To use reinstall.sh here are some hints.


Setup and Config
---------------------

1) Create an /opt/inspire directory  

The directory should be writeable by you, and others installing on this machine

(If you don't like this location, create it somewhere else, taking care to be outside of source trees and invemio location.  If you use a different location, please set it
in CFG_INSPIRE_DIR in the config file .invenio-install.conf described below.)


2) In this directory place the following five files:

* Your current apache config files from your site (try:

cp /opt/invenio/etc/apache/*.conf /opt/inspire/

and should give you two apache config files)

* Your current invenio-local file (something like:

cp /opt/invenio/etc/invenio-local.conf  /opt/inspire/inspire-local.conf

(note the file rename)

Please *make sure* that you have these 3 files saved in /opt/inspire/ before proceeding (otherwise you will have to redo a lot of old work)

* The fourth file may or may not exist. If it exists it is:

cp <your inspire repo>/config-local.mk /opt/inspire/

(Don't worry if you don't have it, just skip this step)

* The fifth file you will create:  

<your editor> /opt/inspire/.invenio_install.conf

(note the leading ".")

And in it you will put:

INVENIO_DB="cdsinvenio"
INVENIO_DB_USER="cdsinvenio"
INVENIO_DB_PASS="<your db password for invenio user>"
MYSQL_ROOT_PASS="<your db root pw, maybe blank>"
INSPIRE_REPO="<your inspire repo>"
INVENIO_REPO="<your invenio repo>"
INSPIRE_DB="<your inspire db name, created in mysql>"
INSPIRE_CONF="/opt/inspire/inspire-local.conf"
CFG_INVENIO_USER="<your bibsched user, probably "apache">"
CONFIGURE_OPTS="<probably blank>"
APACHE_RESTART="<your command, including sudo if needed, to restart apache>"

The first 3 options should be found in your working invenio-local.conf
file

The 4th you may need to test via

mysql -u root -p

The two repos should be well known to you

INSPIRE_DB is not needed if you just want to have one database, and reload
records anytime you switch from atlantis to INSPIRE.   however, you may
like to have a way of keeping 2 dbs on the server, one for INSPIRE and one
for atlantis.   If so, set the INSPIRE DB name here, and make sure to
change it in the /opt/inspire/inspire-local.conf file

INSPIRE_CONF is the saved invenio-local.conf that will be used on your
inspire site.  

CFG_INVENIO_USER is usually apache

CONFIGURE_OPTS are passed to configure when re-running autotools to setup
your invenio build.  See the invenio INSTALL file if you think you need
something here.  COmmonly it is "--with-python='/home/future/python5.3'"
or something like that.  However most sites don't need it at all.


Usage
-------------------------

After saving this config file you should be ready to go:

*** NOTE by default reinstall.sh will kill /opt/invenio and clean your
    repos of non-git content

*** Be very careful to make sure you don't have things you need sitting
    around uncommitted in your repo or in the install directory

*** you can run --dirty  to change this behavior and not clean the site first

<your inspire repo>/conf/reinstall.sh 

This will install an atlantis site, using whatever DB content is sitting
on your site.
 
try adding a --reset-db flag to install and index the atlantis test
records

try adding an --inspire flag to install from the inspire repo (on whatever
branch it is currently checked out on) as well, using your
inspire-local.conf settings.

--inspire --reset-db  

will install new test records, with institutions, and index everything
creating a new INSPIRE site.   This will take 10-20 minutes to complete
(check bibsched to see progress after the initial install.)

sending no switches will install the basic atlantis site

There are a few other options, but this should be all you need.


FIXMEs
--------------------

* There are too many places where DB names and other config options are
  stored.  Many options are listed in /opt/inspire several times, and must
  be changed in sync.

* There should be a saved invenio-local.conf as well for an atlantis site
  with a few customizations
